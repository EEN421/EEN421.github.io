Hey! My name is Ian Hanley. 

As a demonstrated leader and Cyber Security Architect at a leading MXDR MSSP focusing on Microsoft products and services, I specialize in leveraging the Microsoft security fabric effectively and enabling my peers in information security to extract favourable security outcomes. 

As a father of two daughters, I know a thing or two about risk management too.

Cheers,<br/>
Ian D. Hanley
