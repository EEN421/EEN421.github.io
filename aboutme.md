Hi! &#128075 My name is Ian Hanley. 

I’m a **Microsoft Security Architect**, **author**, and **founder of Hanley Cloud Solutions**, where I help organizations—from startups to Fortune 500s—secure and operationalize and secure **Microsoft Defender, Sentinel, Entra, and Azure**.

Over the years, I’ve designed **MSSP-ready services**, built **automation frameworks** that reduce alert fatigue and cost, and helped clients modernize their **Zero Trust** and **SecOps** strategies through practical, threat-informed defense. If it involves the Microsoft security stack, there’s a good chance I’ve architected, automated, or optimized it.

As the creator of [**DevSecOpsDad.com**](https://DevSecOpsDad.com), I share real-world lessons from the trenches—bridging the gap between hands-on engineering and strategic cybersecurity leadership. My book, *[Ultimate Microsoft XDR for Full Spectrum Cyber Defense](https://a.co/d/4vveVCI)*, captures that same philosophy: turning complex Microsoft security ecosystems into clear, actionable roadmaps for defenders.

Outside of work, I’m a proud father of two daughters—and I can confidently say that parenthood has taught me more about **incident response and risk management** than any certification ever could.
