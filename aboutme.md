Hey! My name is Ian Hanley. 

As a Cybersecurity Architect and founder of Hanley Cloud Solutions, I help organizations — from startups to Fortune 500's — secure their Microsoft cloud environments through scalable, cost-effective strategies.

Whether aligning Zero Trust architecture, operationalizing SIEM/SOAR capabilities, or bridging business needs with technical execution, I deliver real outcomes. I’ve designed MSSP-ready security services, built automation frameworks that cut alert fatigue and cost, and improved visibility across the Microsoft security stack.

I’ve also had the privilege of shaping modern SecOps at MSSPs, mentoring security architects, and helping clients get the most from Defender, Sentinel, Entra ID, and Azure. My approach is rooted in threat-informed defense, MITRE ATT&CK, and a healthy dose of curiosity.

Lastly, As a father of two daughters, I know a thing or two about risk management too.

Cheers,
Ian D. Hanley
