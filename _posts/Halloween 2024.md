# What are we building?:
My daughter picked out a sweet halloween mask and I thought to myself... how can we elevate this? 
I've worked on a pair of Raspberry Pi powered 'eyeballs' in the past (great to stick inside a carved out pumpkin) and thought they would be cool in a mask.

The pair of eyes I've previously setup were too bulky to fit inside a mask, so I bought a slimmed down Monster M4SK (board build in, less bulky) and a cheap Lithium Ion Cylindrical Battery (3.7v, 2200mAh). The results are awesome.

# Ian's Insights:

The ability to swiftly respond to threats is crucial in cybersecurity, but even the best Security Operations Centers (SOCs) can face challenges like RBAC configuration mishaps. With the upcoming enforcement of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), relying on user-based service accounts for automation is becoming impractical. By registering an app in EntraID and using PowerShell to automate tasks in Microsoft Defender, you can ensure your SOC remains agile and responsive.
