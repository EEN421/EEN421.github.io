# What are we building?:
My daughter picked out a sweet halloween mask and I thought to myself... how can we elevate this? 
I've worked on a pair of Raspberry Pi powered 'eyeballs' in the past (great to stick inside a carved out pumpkin) and thought they would be cool in a mask.

The pair of eyes I've previously setup were too bulky to fit inside a mask, so I bought a slimmed down Monster M4SK (board build in, less bulky) and a cheap Lithium Ion Cylindrical Battery (3.7v, 2200mAh). The results are awesome. Let's dig in...

Lets start with the Raspberry pi build. I've posted a step-by-step guide to [setting up a headless raspberry pi](https://www.hanley.cloud/2024-02-05-Sentinel-Integrated-RPi-Soil-Sensor-2.0/) using a [custom.toml file](https://github.com/EEN421/EEN421.github.io/blob/master/assets/Code/iothub/custom.toml), which replaces the [WPA_supplicant.conf file](https://github.com/EEN421/Sentinel-Integrated-RPI-Soil-Sensor/blob/Main/Code/wpa_supplicant.conf_) used previously and handles hostname, default account configuration, enables SSH, WLAN config, and Locale on Bookwork OS and later. HOWEVER... the [Animated Eyes Bonnet for Raspberry Pi](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3356) is not compatible with Bookworm so we have to use the older BullseyeOS. To keep things easy, I used the [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) this time around.

# In this Post We Will:
Part 1:
- &#128190; Perform a Headless Raspberry Pi Setup (BullseyeOS).
- &#128268; Connect our Hardware & Deploy our Software Eyes.
- &#128064; Customize Eye shapes, colours, iris, sclera, etc. 
- &#127875; Light up a Pumpkin! 

Part 2:
- &#128297; Customize our Monster M4SK.  
- &#128295; Extend the distance between the eyes.
- &#128123; Spook the neighbour's kids!

# Ian's Insights:

The ability to swiftly respond to threats is crucial in cybersecurity, but even the best Security Operations Centers (SOCs) can face challenges like RBAC configuration mishaps. With the upcoming enforcement of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), relying on user-based service accounts for automation is becoming impractical. By registering an app in EntraID and using PowerShell to automate tasks in Microsoft Defender, you can ensure your SOC remains agile and responsive.

# In this Post:

- &#128268; Registered an Application in Entra ID
- &#x1F512; Managed Application Permissions (Principle of Least Privilege)
- &#x1F511; Configured Application Authentication & Authorization
- &#128297; Built a powershell script to grab our token
- &#128295; Built a powershell script to submit our custom IoC
- &#128296; Ran it!
