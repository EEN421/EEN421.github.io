# Introduction and Use Case:
You're a industrial manufacturing plant manager, you need to prototype, deploy, secure, and remotely manage connected electronic devices at scale. You need to be practical and most importantly, cost-effective. Thankfully, you've made good decisions up to this point and have invested in a SIEM such as Azure Sentinel. Most of your sensor and PLC equipment connects through an API or is compatible with the Azure Monitoring Agent. What do you do for your unsupported but critical IoT architecture (your Raspberry Pi based microcontrollers that help automate the line for example)?

# In this post we will: 
- Call out and solve for pre-requisites
- Configure our 'unsupported' equipment accordingly (Ruby & FluentD Plugin for Log Analytics)
- Create a Log Analytics Workspace
- Retrieve WorkspaceID and Primary Key
- Program the config file for log aggregation (FluentD)
- Log auth and syslog tables to a Log Analytics Workspace
- Explore custom applications (soil moisture and temperature sensors for example)


# Call out and solve for pre-requisites
Typically, the easiest way to send logs to Log Analytics workspace is to leverage the Microsoft OMS Agent. Microsoft supports Linux and has an OMS agent available for both x86 and x64 Linux OS editions but doesnâ€™t support popular ARM platforms like a Raspberry Pi board. The existing OMS agent relies on Ruby, Fluentd, and OMI (this last is the unsupported component on ARM platform).

# Configure our 'unsupported' equipment
1. Install Ruby
```bash
sudo aptitude install ruby-dev
```

2. Check/Confirm Ruby Version:
```bash
ruby --ver
```

3. Install FluentD Unified Log Aggregator & Plugin
```bash
sudo gem install fluentd -v "~> 0.12.0"
sudo fluent-gem install fluent-plugin-td
```

4. Install FluentD Plugn for Azure Log Analytics
```bash
sudo fluent-gem install fluent-plugin-azure-loganalytics
```

# Create a Log Analytics Workspace
1. Navigate to Log Analytics Workspace in Azure Portal: <br/>

5. Commitment / Pricing Tier
Choose the appropriate commitment tier given your expected daily ingest volume. <br/><br/>

	&#128073;      **_Personally, I like to see roughly 15% more ingest than required for the next commitment / pricing tier to insulate against nights, weekends, and holidays which inherently drag down the daily ingest volume average._**
