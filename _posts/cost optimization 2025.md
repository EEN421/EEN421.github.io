# Whitepaper: Cost Optimization in Microsoft Sentinel

## Executive Summary

Microsoft Sentinel provides a modern, cloud-native SIEM and SOAR platform capable of scaling to meet the needs of the most complex enterprises. However, its **consumption-based pricing model**‚Äîcharging per gigabyte of log data ingested‚Äîmeans that poorly managed data pipelines can lead to unexpected and unsustainable costs.

Effective cost optimization in Sentinel is not simply about spending less. It is about achieving **maximum security visibility at the lowest possible cost per insight**. This requires identifying which logs deliver value, eliminating noise, and strategically tuning both ingestion and alerting to align with business risk.

This whitepaper explores proven techniques for cost optimization in Microsoft Sentinel, backed by **KQL (Kusto Query Language) queries** that provide actionable insights. We will cover trend analysis, identification of expensive data sources, daily forecasting, and operational tuning‚Äîequipping both CISOs and SOC leaders with the strategies necessary to optimize costs while preserving the integrity of their security posture.

## The Economics of Sentinel Ingestion

Sentinel pricing is straightforward on paper: each gigabyte of billable data ingested is charged at a fixed rate (region-dependent, typically around \$5.16/GB). In practice, however, data pipelines can involve:

* **High-volume, low-value logs** (e.g., firewall ‚Äúallow‚Äù events).
* **Redundant data ingestion** from multiple connectors.
* **Over-retention of verbose tables** not required for compliance.
* **Noisy alerts** that multiply operational costs through wasted analyst time.

Thus, the optimization question is not *‚ÄúHow do I stop collecting logs?‚Äù* but rather:

* *Which logs drive the highest cost?*
* *Do they materially improve detection, investigation, or compliance?*
* *Where can we reduce volume without reducing security outcomes?*

KQL provides the analytical framework to answer these questions.

## Trend Analysis: Understanding Log Ingestion Over Time

Cost optimization begins with **visibility into ingestion trends**. Sentinel‚Äôs `Usage` table provides granular data on how much volume each data type contributes. The following query compares log ingestion over 30, 60, and 90 days, calculating both growth trends and financial impact:

```kql
// 30/60/90 Day Usage Comparison
let Period90Days = Usage
| where TimeGenerated > ago(90d) and TimeGenerated <= ago(60d)
| where IsBillable == true
| summarize Period90GB = round(todouble(sum(Quantity)) / 1024, 2) by DataType;
let Period60Days = Usage
| where TimeGenerated > ago(60d) and TimeGenerated <= ago(30d)
| where IsBillable == true
| summarize Period60GB = round(todouble(sum(Quantity)) / 1024, 2) by DataType;
let Period30Days = Usage
| where TimeGenerated > ago(30d)
| where IsBillable == true
| summarize Period30GB = round(todouble(sum(Quantity)) / 1024, 2) by DataType;
Period90Days
| join kind=fullouter Period60Days on DataType
| join kind=fullouter Period30Days on DataType
| extend DataType = coalesce(DataType, DataType1, DataType2)
| extend Period90GB = coalesce(Period90GB, 0.0), Period60GB = coalesce(Period60GB, 0.0), Period30GB = coalesce(Period30GB, 0.0)
| extend ChangePct60to30 = iff(Period60GB > 0, round(((Period30GB - Period60GB) / Period60GB) * 100, 1), 0.0)
| extend TrendDirection = case(
    Period30GB > Period60GB and Period60GB > Period90GB, "üìà Increasing",
    Period30GB < Period60GB and Period60GB < Period90GB, "üìâ Decreasing", 
    Period30GB > Period60GB and Period60GB < Period90GB, "üìä Recovery",
    Period30GB < Period60GB and Period60GB > Period90GB, "üìã Peak & Drop",
    "üîÑ Variable")
| project ['Data Source']=DataType, ['Last 30 Days (GB)']=Period30GB, ['30-60 Days Ago (GB)']=Period60GB, ['60-90 Days Ago (GB)']=Period90GB, ['Trend']=TrendDirection
```

**Executive Insight:**

* Increasing trends indicate **escalating costs** that require immediate review.
* Decreasing or variable patterns may reflect **policy changes** or **environment shifts** that need to be validated.
* Long-term visibility allows for **budget forecasting** and **capacity planning**.

## Identifying High-Cost Log Sources

Not all data sources contribute equally. In most Sentinel deployments, a handful of log sources account for the majority of ingestion costs. This query ranks your top 10 most expensive log types:

```kql
let cost=4.30; // Effective cost per GB in your region
search *
| where TimeGenerated >ago(30d)
| where _IsBillable == True
| summarize EventCount=count(), Billable_GB=round(sum(_BilledSize/1000/1000/1000), 2) by Type 
| sort by Billable_GB desc
| extend Estimated_Cost=strcat('$', round(Billable_GB*cost, 2))
| limit 10
```

**Executive Insight:**

* If firewalls or proxies dominate cost, ask: *Do we need every ‚Äúallow‚Äù event?*
* If Office 365 or Azure AD sign-ins drive volume, consider **sampling low-value events** while retaining high-risk ones.
* Cost transparency allows for **chargeback models** to business units, creating accountability for log growth.

**Visual Example:**

## Cost Attribution by Table

For compliance-driven environments, cost optimization often requires table-level attribution. The following query estimates cost for a specific table (e.g., `SecurityEvent`):

```kql
let rate = 4.30;
SecurityEvent
| where TimeGenerated > ago(30d)
| summarize GB = sum(_BilledSize)/1000/1000/1000
| extend cost = GB * rate
```

**Executive Insight:**

* Provides **direct visibility into per-table spend**.
* Useful for **executive reporting**: ‚ÄúThis table costs \$X/month‚Äîhere‚Äôs why we keep it.‚Äù
* Enables **retention trade-offs**: retain high-value logs for 2 years, archive or drop low-value ones after 30 days.



---

## Average Daily Ingestion and Forecasting

Beyond monthly totals, SOC leaders benefit from daily averages for **budget predictability**.

```kql
let rate = 4.30;
Usage
| where TimeGenerated > ago(30d)
| where IsBillable == true
| summarize GB = sum(Quantity)/1000 by bin(TimeGenerated,1d)
| summarize AvgGBPerDay=avg(GB)
| extend Cost=AvgGBPerDay * rate
| project AvgGBPerDay=strcat(round(AvgGBPerDay,2), ' GB/Day'), AvgCostPerDay=strcat('$', round(Cost,2), ' /Day')
```

**Executive Insight:**

* Converts complex ingestion metrics into **simple financial language** (‚ÄúWe spend \$X/day‚Äù).
* Enables **what-if scenarios**: *If we add this log source, what will daily and monthly costs look like?*



---

## Reducing Noise: Security Log Reasons and Device Actions

Some logs inflate costs without materially improving detection. Common examples include **low-severity firewall logs** or repetitive device actions.

**By Reason and Severity:**

```kql
CommonSecurityLog
| where isnotempty(Reason) and Reason != "N/A"
| extend LogSizeBytes = strlen(tostring(pack_all()))
| summarize TotalEvents = count(), TotalGB = sum(LogSizeBytes) / (1024 * 1024 * 1024) by Reason, LogSeverity
| extend RawCost = round(TotalGB * 5.16, 2)
| sort by TotalEvents desc
| project Reason, LogSeverity, TotalEvents, TotalGB, IngestCost = strcat('$', tostring(RawCost))
| top 10 by TotalEvents desc
```

**By Device Action Over Time:**

```kql
let Period90Days = CommonSecurityLog
| where TimeGenerated > ago(90d) and TimeGenerated <= ago(60d)
| extend DeviceAction = tostring(coalesce(DeviceAction, "Unknown"))
| summarize Period90Count = count() by DeviceAction;
// repeat for 60d, 30d, join & calculate changes...
```

**Executive Insight:**

* Overly verbose logs can be **filtered before ingestion**, reducing costs dramatically.
* Tracking device actions helps confirm that **policy changes reduce noise as expected**.

## Operational Optimization: Alert Fatigue and Analyst Time

Data ingestion is not the only cost driver‚Äî**alert fatigue** wastes analyst time, which is often more expensive than log storage. This query identifies the top 10 most common alerts, their percentage of total, and assigns an impact level:

```kql
let totalAlerts = toscalar(SecurityAlert
    | where TimeGenerated > ago(90d)
    | summarize TotalCount = count());
SecurityAlert
| where TimeGenerated > ago(90d)
| summarize Count = count() by AlertName
| top 10 by Count desc
| extend PercentageValue = round((Count * 100.0) / totalAlerts, 2)
| extend Percentage = strcat(PercentageValue, '%')
| extend Alert_Severity = case(
                              PercentageValue > 20, 'üî• High Impact', 
                              PercentageValue > 10, '‚ö†Ô∏è Moderate', 
                              '‚úÖ Low Impact')
| project AlertName, Count, Percentage, ["Impact Level"] = Alert_Severity
```

**Executive Insight:**

* Frequent, low-value alerts should be tuned or suppressed to preserve analyst focus.
* This reduces **hidden operational costs** associated with wasted triage cycles.

## Strategic Recommendations

To achieve sustainable cost optimization, organizations should adopt a **multi-layered strategy**:

1. **Measure Before Cutting** ‚Äì Use KQL to identify what is driving cost before taking action.
2. **Prioritize by Business Value** ‚Äì Retain logs tied to compliance and threat detection; filter those with low security relevance.
3. **Leverage Data Collection Rules (DCRs)** ‚Äì Transform and filter logs **before** they hit Sentinel.
4. **Adopt Tiered Retention** ‚Äì Use Basic Logs and Archive tiers for compliance-driven but low-value data.
5. **Tune Analytics Rules** ‚Äì Reduce noisy alerts to save both compute and analyst time.
6. **Establish Chargeback Models** ‚Äì Drive accountability by assigning costs to business owners of data sources.

## Conclusion

Microsoft Sentinel delivers immense value, but without active management, ingestion-based billing can spiral out of control. Cost optimization is not about reducing visibility‚Äîit is about aligning visibility with **security priorities and business risk tolerance**.

By leveraging the queries and strategies outlined in this whitepaper, organizations can:

* Maintain strong security visibility.
* Predict and control monthly costs.
* Eliminate waste and focus analyst effort on what matters most.

With KQL as both microscope and scalpel, security leaders can transform Sentinel from a **cost center** into a **strategic enabler of cyber resilience**.
