```

<br/>
<br/>

# PHASE 3: Create Project Directory (1 minute)
```bash
# Create directory
cd ~
mkdir -p gc9a01_eye
cd gc9a01_eye
```

<br/>

# PHASE 5: Create Eye Scripts 

Copy and paste the different [python powered eyeballs from my Github page](https://github.com/EEN421/Halloween-2025/tree/Main/gc9a01/eyes) into the working folder on your Raspberry Pi.



# PHASE 7: Set Up Auto-Start on Boot
"""
Choose which eye you want to run on boot, then:
"""

```bash
# Create systemd service
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/eyeball.service
```

Paste this (change the script name if using a differnt eye.py file): 

```bash
ini[Unit]
Description=GC9A01 Eyeball Display
After=multi-user.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=cyclops
WorkingDirectory=/home/cyclops/gc9a01_eye
ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /home/cyclops/gc9a01_eye/bloodshot.py # <-- ⚠️ Change ThisGuy.py to your preferred eye animation 👀
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=10

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
Save with Ctrl+X, Y, Enter.
Enable auto-start:
bash# Reload systemd
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```


# Enable service to start on boot
```bash
sudo systemctl enable eyeball.service
```

# Start it now (test without rebooting)
```bash
sudo systemctl start eyeball.service
```

# Check status
```bash
sudo systemctl status eyeball.service
```
Should show: Active: active (running)

Test by rebooting:
```bash
sudo reboot -h now
```

Wait 30-60 seconds after boot, and the eye should start automatically!

# PHASE 8: Control Commands (Reference)
```bash
# Stop the eye
sudo systemctl stop eyeball.service

# Start the eye
sudo systemctl start eyeball.service

# Restart the eye (after making changes)
sudo systemctl restart eyeball.service

# Disable auto-start on boot
sudo systemctl disable eyeball.service

# View live logs
sudo journalctl -u eyeball.service -f

# View last 50 log lines
sudo journalctl -u eyeball.service -n 50
```

# Customization Tips
Change Eye Colors
```bash
sudo nano ~/gc9a01_eye/eyeball.py
Find these lines near the top and modify:
python# Make it more orange/red
IRIS_COLOR = (255, 100, 0)
FLAME_INNER = (255, 150, 0)

# Make it green
IRIS_COLOR = (100, 255, 100)
FLAME_INNER = (150, 255, 100)

#After changing, restart:
sudo systemctl restart eye.service
```

Switch to Different Eye
```bash
# Edit service file
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/eye.service

# Change the ExecStart line to:
ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /home/cyclops/gc9a01_eye/bloodshot.py

# Reload and restart
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart eye.service
```

# Quick Troubleshooting
Eye doesn't start on boot:
```bash
bashsudo systemctl status eye.service
sudo journalctl -u eye.service -n 50
Display shows nothing:
bash# Check wiring
# Verify SPI is enabled
ls /dev/spidev*
Low FPS:
bash# Check CPU temperature
vcgencmd measure_temp

# If overheating, add cooling
Need to stop it quickly:
bashsudo systemctl stop eye.service
```

# The Great **GC9A01** Color Mystery: A Debugging Story 🔍

This is a perfect example of hardware debugging! Here's how we solved it:

---

## The Problem

When we first got your display working, we ran into a frustrating issue:

**Symptoms:**
- ✅ Display turned white when we sent solid white color (so wiring was correct!)
- ✅ SPI communication was working
- ❌ But when we tried to draw an animated eye: got weird results
  - "Dark ring with a white circle in the middle"
  - Shapes were wrong
  - Colors looked completely off

**First attempt:** Basic eye with PIL circles → Didn't work right

---

## The Breakthrough: The Color Test

I created a simple test that filled the entire screen with different solid colors in sequence:

```python
# Test each color one by one
fill_color(255, 0, 0, "RED")      # Should be red
fill_color(0, 255, 0, "GREEN")    # Should be green  
fill_color(0, 0, 255, "BLUE")     # Should be blue
fill_color(255, 255, 0, "YELLOW") # Should be yellow
fill_color(0, 255, 255, "CYAN")   # Should be cyan
fill_color(255, 0, 255, "MAGENTA")# Should be magenta
fill_color(255, 255, 255, "WHITE")# Should be white
```

### Your Results Were Bizarre:

❌ **RED**: Dark/invisible - couldn't see it  
❌ **GREEN**: Dark/invisible - couldn't see it  
❌ **BLUE**: Dark/invisible - couldn't see it  
✅ **YELLOW**: Visible!  
✅ **CYAN**: Visible!  
✅ **MAGENTA**: Visible!  
✅ **WHITE**: Visible!

---

## What This Told Us (The Eureka Moment!)

This was **THE KEY CLUE**:

- **Single color channels** (pure R, G, or B) = invisible/dark
- **Mixed color channels** (combinations) = visible!

This pattern meant:

> **The display's voltage levels and gamma correction were not properly configured!**

When you send pure red (255, 0, 0), the display needs proper voltage levels to drive just the red sub-pixels. Without correct power settings, single colors appeared too dim or dark.

But when you sent yellow (255, 255, 0), you're driving BOTH red AND green together, which apparently had enough combined voltage to be visible.

---

## The Solution: Full Power Initialization

Our initial code used a **minimal initialization sequence**:

```python
# MINIMAL (what we started with - DIDN'T WORK)
def init(self):
    self.reset()
    self.cmd(0x11)  # Sleep out
    time.sleep(0.12)
    self.cmd(0x36, 0x48)  # Memory access
    self.cmd(0x3A, 0x05)  # Pixel format
    self.cmd(0x21)        # Inversion on
    self.cmd(0x29)        # Display on
```

This was missing **critical power and gamma settings!**

The GC9A01 datasheet shows it needs **dozens of voltage and gamma registers** configured:

```python
# FULL INITIALIZATION (what fixed it)
def init(self):
    self.reset()
    
    # Power control registers (12 of them!)
    self.cmd(0x84, 0x40)
    self.cmd(0x85, 0xFF)
    self.cmd(0x86, 0xFF)
    # ... many more ...
    
    # Gamma correction (CRITICAL!)
    self.cmd(0xF0, 0x45, 0x09, 0x08, 0x08, 0x26, 0x2A)
    self.cmd(0xF1, 0x43, 0x70, 0x72, 0x36, 0x37, 0x6F)
    # ... gamma tables for accurate colors ...
    
    # Then sleep out and display on
    self.cmd(0x11)
    self.cmd(0x29)
```

---

## The Quadrant Test (Verification)

After adding the full initialization, I created a **4-quadrant test** to verify:

```python
# Top-left: WHITE
# Top-right: YELLOW  
# Bottom-left: CYAN
# Bottom-right: MAGENTA
```

You reported: **"I can't take a photo because my camera sees all the quadrants as 'white' given how bright the display is"**

🎉 **SUCCESS!** The display was so bright now that your camera couldn't capture the individual colors - but you could see all 4 distinct colored quadrants with your eyes!

---

## Why This Happens: The Technical Explanation

### 1. **Voltage Levels**
LCDs need precise voltages to drive the liquid crystal layers:
- Too low = pixels don't activate (appear dark)
- Too high = pixels overdrive (burn out or look wrong)
- Just right = beautiful colors

### 2. **Gamma Correction**
Human eyes don't perceive brightness linearly. A value of 128 doesn't look "half as bright" as 255.

Gamma correction compensates:
```
Without gamma: Input 128 → Display looks too dark
With gamma:    Input 128 → Display adjusted → Looks "half bright" to human eye
```

The GC9A01 has gamma tables (those 0xF0, 0xF1, 0xF2, 0xF3 commands) that map input values to actual voltages.

### 3. **Why Mixed Colors Worked**

When you sent:
- **Red only (255, 0, 0)**: One set of sub-pixels trying to light up with wrong voltage = too dim
- **Yellow (255, 255, 0)**: TWO sets of sub-pixels (red + green) = enough combined light to see

It's like trying to light a room:
- One dim bulb = can barely see (single color)
- Two dim bulbs = enough light to navigate (mixed colors)
- Proper wiring = all bulbs at full brightness (full initialization)

## The Debugging Process Flow

```
1. White test → ✅ Display physically works
           ↓
2. Animated eye → ❌ Looks wrong (dark shapes)
           ↓
3. Color test → 🔍 Discovery: single colors invisible!
           ↓
4. Research → "This looks like voltage/gamma issue"
           ↓
5. Add full init → 🎉 All colors work!
           ↓
6. Quadrant test → ✅ Verified success
           ↓
7. Optimize speed → numpy conversion (4→10 FPS)
```

---

## Lessons Learned

### 1. **Systematic Testing**
We didn't just try random fixes. We:
- Started simple (solid colors)
- Isolated variables (one color at a time)
- Found a pattern (mixed vs single)
- Formed hypothesis (voltage issue)
- Tested solution (full init)
- Verified (quadrant test)

### 2. **The Pattern Was Key**
"Some colors work, others don't" immediately suggested **incomplete initialization**, not wiring or SPI issues.

### 3. **Datasheets Matter**
The GC9A01 datasheet has a recommended initialization sequence with 50+ register writes. Skipping steps = weird behavior!

### 4. **Trust Your Hardware**
Your wiring was perfect from the start. The issue was software configuration, not physical connections.

---

## Common GC9A01 Pitfalls (What We Avoided)

❌ **Wrong color order** (RGB vs BGR) → Would show wrong colors, not dark  
❌ **Wrong SPI speed** → Would show noise/corruption, not selective darkness  
❌ **Bad wiring** → Would show nothing or random pixels  
✅ **Missing initialization** → Exactly what we had! Selective color issues

---

## Why Online Tutorials Often Work "Out of the Box"

Many GC9A01 libraries use the **full initialization by default** because the authors learned this the hard way too!

When I started with a "minimal" init to keep code simple, we hit the same trap that many beginners face.

---

## The Happy Ending

After adding the full initialization:
- ✅ All colors work perfectly
- ✅ Display is bright and vivid  
- ✅ Dragon eye looks amazing
- ✅ 8-10 FPS performance
- ✅ Auto-starts on boot

**Your display went from "barely working" to "production ready" just by properly configuring those internal registers!**

---

## Key Takeaway for Future Projects

**When testing displays:**

1. **Always test primary colors individually first**
   - Red, Green, Blue solo
   - Then combinations

2. **If you get weird selective behavior** (some things work, others don't):
   - Not wiring
   - Not SPI  
   - Probably **initialization/configuration**

3. **Read the datasheet initialization section** - those register values exist for a reason!

This debugging session is a perfect example of methodical troubleshooting paying off! 🔍🎉
