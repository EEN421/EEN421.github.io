# KQL Toolbox 🛠️ & PowerShell Toolbox 🧰 are live on Amazon!

After publishing the PowerShell Toolbox and KQL Toolbox blog series, one thing became clear:

The individual tools were useful — _but the system they formed was harder to see._

So I turned them into books. Today, I’m officially announcing the release of two companion volumes:

**_PowerShell Toolbox — a practitioner’s guide to building audit-ready, defensible automation_**

**_KQL Toolbox — a practitioner’s guide to cost, signal, and response discipline in Microsoft Sentinel_**

Each book is built from the same real-world problems explored in the blog posts on this site — but organized, expanded, and connected into a cohesive operating model.

If you’ve followed the blog series closely, a fair question is: _Why publish books at all — and why buy them if you’ve already read every article?_

The rest of this post answers that question directly.

## The Blogs Provide Tools — The Books Provide Systems

The Toolbox blog posts are intentionally **modular**.

You can:

* Read one post in isolation
* Copy a script or query
* Get an answer
* Move on

That’s exactly what blogs should do.

But security operations do not fail because teams lack *tools*.
They fail because those tools are not connected into a **coherent operating model**.

The books exist to provide that model.

## What the Blogs Don’t Try to Do (On Purpose)

Blogs are the wrong place to fully explain:

* Why problems appear in a specific order
* How cost, exposure, identity, and response compound over time
* When automation becomes liability instead of leverage
* Why “working” scripts and queries quietly rot
* What breaks six months later, not six minutes later

Trying to force that depth into blog posts would make them worse — heavier, longer, and less usable.

So I didn’t.

The books exist to carry that weight instead.

## Two Toolboxes, One Shared Philosophy

Although the PowerShell Toolbox and KQL Toolbox focus on different layers of the stack, they share the same underlying idea:

> **Security maturity comes from disciplined visibility, not more dashboards or detections.**

Each book organizes its tools into an intentional progression — something the blogs intentionally avoid.

---

## The KQL Toolbox Book: From Data to Discipline

The **KQL Toolbox blogs** give you targeted answers:

* How much am I paying for ingest?
* Which logs are the noisiest?
* What changed?
* Where is phishing or identity risk hiding?
* What detections actually get acted on?

The **book** connects those answers into a **Sentinel operating model**.

### What the book adds that the blogs do not:

* A clear maturity arc:
  **Economic control → signal quality → risk understanding → response reality**
* Guidance on *when not to hunt yet*
* How poor cost and signal decisions distort every downstream security decision
* How to explain Sentinel tradeoffs to leadership, auditors, and finance
* How to measure success by outcomes, not query count

The blogs give you queries.
The book teaches you how to **run Sentinel intentionally**.

---

## The PowerShell Toolbox Book: From Automation to Evidence

The **PowerShell Toolbox blogs** give you powerful scripts:

* Network and exposure audits
* Privileged role reviews
* Group Policy snapshots
* Script quality validation

Each one works.
Each one solves a real pain point.

The **book** reframes those scripts as **security artifacts**, not just automation.

### What the book adds that the blogs do not:

* An automation maturity arc:
  **Visibility → authority → policy → trust**
* How to design scripts as **audit evidence**
* How to avoid one-off scripts becoming long-term liabilities
* How to make automation defensible, repeatable, and reviewable
* How to build scripts you’d be comfortable defending six months later

The blogs help you *run scripts*.
The book helps you *stand behind them*.

---

## Why the Books Still Matter If You’ve Read Everything

If you’ve read every Toolbox article, you already have the tools.

What the books provide is:

* Structure
* Context
* Judgment
* A mental model

They answer questions the blogs intentionally leave open:

* *Which of these problems must be solved first?*
* *What breaks if I skip a step?*
* *What looks impressive but delivers no operational value?*
* *What does “mature” actually mean in practice?*

This is the difference between:

> “I know how to do this”
> and
> “I know why we do it this way.”

What the EPUBs Contain That the Blogs Do Not

The Toolbox books are not collections of blog posts.

They include material that was never published on the site and could not exist in blog form without breaking what makes the blogs useful.

1. A Deliberate End-to-End Operational Arc

The blogs are modular by design.
Each one stands alone.

The EPUBs introduce intentional sequencing:

What must be understood first

What depends on that understanding

What fails if steps are skipped

Where teams usually misorder their efforts

This sequencing is explicit in the books and absent from the blogs.

You don’t just learn how to run a query or script — you learn when it belongs in the lifecycle.

2. Book-Only Transitions and Synthesis

Between chapters, the EPUBs contain connecting narrative that does not appear anywhere on the blog:

Why cost control precedes threat hunting

Why visibility precedes privilege review

Why detection coverage collapses without response discipline

Why automation without trust becomes liability

These transitions are where most of the thinking happens — and they only exist in the books.

3. Failure Modes and Long-Term Consequences

Blogs optimize for action.
Books can afford to explore what goes wrong later.

The EPUBs include:

Common misinterpretations of query results

How teams accidentally optimize the wrong metrics

Where scripts silently stop being trustworthy

How “successful” tooling creates blind spots over time

This content is intentionally excluded from the blogs to keep them usable.

4. Decision Guidance, Not Just Execution

The blog posts answer:

“How do I do this?”

The EPUBs answer:

“Should I do this now?”
“What does this decision unlock — or block — later?”
“What tradeoff am I accepting?”

That guidance exists only in the books.

5. Scripts and Queries Treated as Evidence

In the blogs:

Scripts and queries are tools

In the EPUBs:

They are security artifacts

The books introduce:

How outputs should be interpreted

How often tools should be rerun

What constitutes drift

What “defensible” looks like in audits or incident reviews

This framing is absent from the blogs.

6. A Stable, Offline, Authoritative Reference

This isn’t about convenience — it’s about trust.

The EPUBs provide:

A fixed reference point

A versioned body of reasoning

A place where assumptions and intent are preserved

Something you can rely on during audits, incidents, or redesigns

Blogs evolve.
The books define.

7. Explicit Audience Assumptions

The books assume:

You already know the basics

You already run these platforms

You are accountable for outcomes

The blogs must stay approachable.
The books can be honest.

That honesty is book-only.

The Real Difference

The blogs help you execute.

The EPUBs help you decide.

That is not a pricing distinction.
It is a content distinction.
