📚 The DevSecOpsDad Toolbox — Built for MSSPs, Architects, and SOC Leaders

If you lead a SOC, design security platforms, or run security services for other organizations, you already know the uncomfortable truth:

Most security failures don’t come from missing tools — they come from unmanaged decisions.

Costs drift. Signal degrades. Automation sprawls. Detections exist, but no one can prove they improved response when it mattered.

The DevSecOpsDad Toolbox books were written for exactly that reality.

Not for beginners.
Not for checkbox compliance.
For people who are accountable.

🧰 KQL Toolbox

Turning Logs into Decisions in Microsoft Sentinel & Defender XDR

KQL Toolbox is written for teams operating Microsoft Sentinel and Defender XDR at scale — across tenants, customers, or business units — where telemetry decisions have real financial and operational consequences.

This book focuses on:

Cost ownership — knowing why you’re paying for data, not just how much

Signal discipline — eliminating noise without creating blind spots

Detection credibility — understanding when detections actually improve outcomes

Response measurement — proving that time, effort, and spend reduce harm

The chapters follow a deliberate maturity arc:

Economic control → signal quality → risk understanding → response reality

For MSSPs, this translates directly into:

Defensible pricing conversations

Clear explanations for customers when costs spike

Consistent decision-making across tenants

Reduced firefighting caused by inherited telemetry chaos

For architects and SOC leads, it provides the missing layer between coverage and control.

🧰 PowerShell Toolbox

Hands-On Automation for Auditing and Defense

PowerShell Toolbox addresses a different, equally dangerous problem:

Automation that works — until someone questions it.

This book is written for leaders responsible for automation that must survive:

Customer audits

Incident response scrutiny

Peer review

Long-term operational drift

Rather than treating scripts as utilities, PowerShell Toolbox treats them as security artifacts.

The automation maturity arc is intentional:

Discovery → Authority → Configuration → Evidence

Each phase answers questions MSSPs and architects are regularly asked:

How do we know this is accurate?

Who has authority to act on this output?

What changed, and when?

Can we defend this result six months from now?

This is automation designed to scale without becoming technical debt.

Why These Books Matter at Leadership Level

If you’re responsible for:

Multiple environments

Customer trust

Budget justification

Audit outcomes

Incident narratives

Then activity alone is not enough.

Dashboards without ownership are theater.
Automation without defensibility is risk.
Telemetry without discipline becomes liability.

The DevSecOpsDad Toolbox exists to help leaders move from:

“We collect a lot of data”
to

“We can explain, defend, and act on what we collect.”

Who This Is For — and Who It Isn’t

These books are for:

MSSP practice leads

Security architects

SOC managers and directors

Detection engineering leaders

They assume:

Production environments

Real constraints

Real consequences

They are not quick-start guides or collections of tricks.

They are guides for building security operations that hold up when someone asks hard questions.

Available Now

Both KQL Toolbox and PowerShell Toolbox are available in Kindle and paperback, with companion GitHub repositories maintained alongside the books.

If your role involves explaining why decisions were made — not just what was done — these books were written for you.

Stay disciplined.
