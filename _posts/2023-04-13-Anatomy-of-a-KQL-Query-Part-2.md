# Introduction and Use Case:

Continuing from a previous post, today we'll dissect even more simple but powerful KQL queries that are essential to keep in your threat hunting utility belt.

# Recap:

In my last post, we broke down some helpful, basic KQL queries and syntax:

- Defining **table** to query against
- Defining **time** periods manually and via GUI
- Filtering out **non-billable** query results
- Leveraged the **Summarize** function to manipulate results
- Graphing results to **chart**
- Querying specific **devices**
- Querying the **Usage table** for **anomalies**

# How verbose is an EventID?
```sql
SecurityEvent // <--Define the table to query

| where EventID == "4663" // <--Query for specific EventID

| summarize count() by bin(TimeGenerated,1d) // <--Return count per day

| render columnchart // <--Graph a column chart
```

# Which Devices are Throwing a Specific EventID?

```sql
SecurityEvent // <--Define the table to query

| where EventID == "4663"   // <--Query for specific EventID

| summarize count() by Computer // <--Return count per computer
```

# How often does a specific computer throw a specific EventID over a defined timespan?

```sql
SecurityEvent   // <--Define the table to query

| where EventID == "4663"   // <--Query for specific EventID

| where Computer == "This Guy" // <--Query a specific device

| summarize count() by bin(TimeGenerated,1d) // <--Return count per day

| render columnchart // <--Graph results to chart
```

# Summary:

In this post, we broke down some helpful, basic KQL queries and syntax:

- Defining **table** to query against
- Querying for specific **EventIDs**
- Querying specific **devices**
- Combining these to query for **specific EventIDs on specific devices**
- Leveraged the **Summarize** function to manipulate data (break totals up by day etc.)
- Graphing results to **chart**
