🔍 KQL Toolbox #6 — From Junk Clicks to Identity & Privilege Control

Last week in KQL Toolbox #5, we hunted phishing and malware like pros — sender domains, payloads, campaigns, and patterns.

But here’s the truth:

Even the best detections don’t matter if users still click… and identity controls aren’t watching what happens next.

So this week, we pivot from threat hunting to risk outcomes:

- Who’s clicking junk mail links? (human-risk telemetry)
- Who deleted an AD user? (identity tampering)
- Who’s activating privileged roles via PIM? (privilege oversight)

Let’s break each query down line-by-line and show how to operationalize them like a real SOC.

<br/><br/>

# 1️⃣ Who’s Clicking on Junk Mail?

```kql
let JunkedEmails = EmailEvents
| where DeliveryLocation == "Junk folder"
| distinct NetworkMessageId;
UrlClickEvents
| where NetworkMessageId in(JunkedEmails)
```

### [🔗 Who's Clicking on Junk Mail? Query Available Here](https://github.com/EEN421/KQL-Queries/blob/Main/Who's%20Clicking%20on%20Junk%20Mail%3F.kql)

<br/>

## Line-by-line breakdown (what each piece is doing)

### `let JunkedEmails = EmailEvents`

Creates a named variable called JunkedEmails.

EmailEvents is the Microsoft Defender for Office / email telemetry table that tracks delivery and classification outcomes.

✅ Why this matters: Using let makes the query modular, readable, and reusable — you’re building a “set” of message IDs you’ll pivot on.

<br/>

### `| where DeliveryLocation == "Junk folder"`

Filters the email dataset down to only messages delivered into the Junk folder.

✅ Why this matters: This is the “your filters worked… BUT” moment.
These emails were already treated as suspicious/low-trust — yet people can still interact with them.

<br/>

### `| distinct NetworkMessageId;`

Extracts only unique message identifiers.

NetworkMessageId is the glue key that lets you correlate the same email across Defender tables (delivery, URL clicks, attachments, post-delivery actions, etc.).

✅ Why this matters: We’re building a clean list of “junk emails” we can match against user click activity.

<br/>

### `UrlClickEvents`

Switches to the table that records user clicks on URLs from messages.

This is where the rubber meets the road: user behavior.

<br/>

### `| where NetworkMessageId in(JunkedEmails)`

Filters click events down to only clicks that match the junk email message IDs you captured above.

✅ What you get out of this query:

- “Which junked messages were clicked”
- And (depending on your tenant’s schema) usually:
    - who clicked
     - what URL
     - when
     - from which device/IP/browser

This is your “risky click” leaderboard. What it tells you (in plain English): _Users are clicking links from emails that already landed in Junk._
That’s a human-risk signal and a great leading indicator for phishing exposure.

## ⚔️ Steps to Operationalize

- Enrich it (add who/URL/time columns) and build a “Top Clickers” view.
- Set thresholds: e.g., 2+ junk clicks in 7 days = investigation / targeted training.
- Automate response:
    - user notification
    - password reset / token revoke if high-risk
    - block URL/domain if repeated
- Measure improvement month-over-month (this is how you prove your awareness program works).
- Escalate when clicks tie to known bad domains or credential-harvest paths.

# 2️⃣ Who Deleted an AD User?

```kql
SecurityEvent
| where TimeGenerated > ago (90d)
| where EventID == "4726"
| extend Actor_ = Account
| project-reorder TimeGenerated, Activity, Actor_, TargetAccount, Computer
```

### [🔗 Who Deleted an AD User? KQL Query Available Here](https://github.com/EEN421/KQL-Queries/blob/Main/Who_Deleted_an_AD_User%3F.kql)

<br/>

## Line-by-line breakdown

### `SecurityEvent`

Queries Windows Security Event Logs forwarded to Sentinel / Log Analytics.

This is where classic AD audit logging lives (account changes, group membership, logons, etc.).


### `| where TimeGenerated > ago (90d)`

Limits results to the last 90 days.

Keeps costs/performance reasonable and focuses on relevant incidents.

✅ Pro tip: for alerting, you’ll tighten this to 1h/24h. For audits, 30–180 days is common.

### `| where EventID == "4726"`

Filters to Event ID 4726: “A user account was deleted.”

✅ Why this matters: Deleting users is identity destruction.
If attackers can’t keep persistence, sometimes they burn the house down on their way out.

### `| extend Actor_ = Account`

Creates a new column Actor_ from the Account field (the actor who performed the deletion).

✅ Why this matters: explicit naming helps readability and makes it easier to join with other actor-based queries later.

### `| project-reorder TimeGenerated, Activity, Actor_, TargetAccount, Computer`

Keeps only the most important columns and reorders them for analyst-friendly output.

✅ What you get:
- When it happened
- What happened (Activity)
- Who did it (Actor_)
- Who got deleted (TargetAccount)
- Where it happened (Computer)

What it tells you
- Which identities are being deleted, and who is doing it.

This supports:
- change control validation
- insider threat detection
- compromise investigation
- audit evidence

## 🛡️ Regulatory & Framework Mapping

**NIST 800-53**
- AC-2 Account management
- AU-2 / AU-3 / AU-6 audit event definition, content, and review

**CMMC 2.0**
- AC.L2-3.1.1 / AC.L2-3.1.2 access control enforcement
- AU.L2-3.3.1 / AU.L2-3.3.3 audit log review

<br/>

**CIS v8**
- Control 5 Account Management
- Control 8 Audit Log Management
- Steps to Operationalize
- Alert in near-real-time (last 1h/24h) for account deletions.

<br/>

## ⚔️ Steps to Operationalize
**Escalate immediately if:**
- the deleted user was privileged
- deletion occurred outside approved change window
- actor is unusual/new

**Correlate with:**
- group membership changes (4732/4728)
- privilege activations (PIM)
- suspicious logons (4624/4625 patterns)

**Create an audit report for IAM:** deletions vs ticket approvals.

**Harden:** ensure only tightly controlled accounts can delete users.

<br/><br/>

# 3️⃣ Who’s Activating Roles via PIM?

```kql
AuditLogs
| where Category == "RoleManagement"
| where ActivityDisplayName == "Add member to role completed (PIM activation)"
| extend Actor = tostring(parse_json(InitiatedBy).user.displayName)
| extend IP = tostring(parse_json(InitiatedBy).user.ipAddress)
| extend Role = tostring(parse_json(TargetResources)[0].displayName)
| extend ActivationTime = TimeGenerated
| project Actor, Role, ActivationTime, IP
```

### [🔗 Who's Activating PIM Roles? KQL Query Available Here](https://github.com/EEN421/KQL-Queries/blob/Main/Who's%20Activating%20Roles%20via%20PIM%3F.kql)

<br/>

## Line-by-line breakdown

### `AuditLogs`

Queries Entra ID (Azure AD) audit logs ingested to Sentinel / Log Analytics.

This is where identity governance actions show up: role changes, app consent, group changes, etc.

<br/>

### `| where Category == "RoleManagement"`

Narrows to role-related events.

✅ Why it matters: keeps your query clean and fast.

<br/>

### `| where ActivityDisplayName == "Add member to role completed (PIM activation)"`

Filters specifically to the audit event emitted when a user completes a PIM role activation.

✅ Translation: “Who elevated to admin… right now?”

<br/>

### `| extend Actor = tostring(parse_json(InitiatedBy).user.displayName)`

Parses the JSON blob inside InitiatedBy.

Extracts the initiating user’s display name.

✅ Why it matters: AuditLogs are nested JSON; parsing is how you get clean columns.

### `| extend IP = tostring(parse_json(InitiatedBy).user.ipAddress)`

Pulls the initiator’s IP address.

✅ Why it matters:

verify corporate vs external IP

detect risky geo/IP anomalies

correlate with suspicious sign-ins

<br/>

### `| extend Role = tostring(parse_json(TargetResources)[0].displayName)`

Extracts the role that was activated (the “target resource”).

Uses index [0] because TargetResources is an array.

✅ Why it matters: Now you can build a “Top Activated Roles” and baseline your privileged access patterns.

<br/>

### `| extend ActivationTime = TimeGenerated`

Makes the event time explicit and readable.

<br/>

### `| project Actor, Role, ActivationTime, IP`

Outputs exactly what an auditor and a SOC analyst both care about.

✅ “Who, what, when, where.”

What it tells you

Who is elevating privileges via PIM, what role they activated, and where they came from.

This is your strongest “least privilege is real” evidence.

## 🛡️ Regulatory & Framework Mapping

**NIST 800-53**
- AC-2 Account management (privileged assignment activity)
- AC-6 Least privilege (JIT elevation)
- AU-2 / AU-6 audit and review

<br/>

**CMMC 2.0**
- AC.L2-3.1.5 least privilege
- AC.L2-3.1.6 privileged account management
- AU.L2-3.3.1 / AU.L2-3.3.3 auditing and review

<br/>

**CIS v8**
- Control 6 Access Control Management
- Control 5 Account Management

<br/>

## ⚔️ Steps to Operationalize
- Daily PIM activation digest to SOC + IAM.
- Baseline: normal roles, normal people, normal hours, normal IP ranges.
- Alert on anomalies:
    - rare roles (Global Admin / Privileged Role Admin)
    - activation outside business hours
    - unfamiliar IP / risky sign-in correlation
    - Correlate justification (ticket/approval) for audit defense.

Use it for access reviews: “Why is this role activated so often?”

<br/><br/>

# Who’s RDP’ing into Domain Controllers?

If the last section was about identity lifecycle tampering (deletions), the next question is:

“Cool… but did anyone get hands-on-keyboard access to the domain?”

This query focuses on RDP session activity (logon/logoff/reconnect/disconnect) specifically in your domain controller security logs—giving you a fast way to confirm whether interactive admin access is happening, and who’s involved.

## RDP Query A — Session activity timeline (quick triage view)

```kql
SecurityEvent
| where TimeGenerated > ago(30d)
| where EventID in (4624, 4634, 4778, 4779)
// Early filtering before parsing
| where AccountType != "Machine"  // More efficient than string matching
| where Account !has "SYSTEM" and Account !endswith "$"
// Filter to RDP only for logons, keep all logoff/reconnect/disconnect
| where EventID != 4624 or LogonType == 10
| project 
    TimeGenerated,
    DomainController = Computer,
    Activity,
    User = coalesce(TargetUserName, Account)
| order by TimeGenerated desc
```

### [🔗 Who's Logging In and When?.kql](https://github.com/EEN421/KQL-Queries/blob/Main/Who's%20Logging%20In%20and%20When%3F.kql)

<br/>

## Line-by-line breakdown

Pulls Windows Security logs (your “source of truth” for authentication + session events)...

### `| where TimeGenerated > ago(30d)`

Limits the dataset to the last 30 days.

✅ Keeps it relevant and performant.

<br/>

### `| where EventID in (4624, 4634, 4778, 4779)`

You’re selecting the session lifecycle events:
- 4624 = Successful logon
- 4634 = Logoff
- 4778 = RDP session reconnected
- 4779 = RDP session disconnected

✅ This is what turns a single logon into a full session narrative.

<br/>

### `| where AccountType != "Machine"`

Drops machine accounts.

✅ Reduces “background noise” and keeps focus on human/operator behavior.

<br/>

### `| where Account !has "SYSTEM" and Account !endswith "$"`

More noise reduction:

removes SYSTEM activity

removes typical computer-account naming patterns ($)

✅ Makes your results more SOC-useful by default.

<br/>

### `| where EventID != 4624 or LogonType == 10`

This is the smart logic in the updated version.

If it’s a 4624 logon event → only keep it when LogonType == 10 (RDP)

If it’s a 4634/4778/4779 event → keep it, because those represent RDP session behavior (logoff/reconnect/disconnect)

✅ Result: you avoid non-RDP 4624 logons while preserving the RDP lifecycle events.

<br/>

### `| project ...`

Keeps output tight and analyst-friendly:

TimeGenerated — when it happened

DomainController = Computer — rename Computer for clarity in this context

Activity — readable description of the event

User = coalesce(TargetUserName, Account) — selects the best available user field

✅ This makes it “drop into a workbook / incident note” clean.

<br/>

### `| order by TimeGenerated desc`

Newest events at the top (SOC-friendly default).

What Query A tells you

A time-ordered timeline of RDP session activity involving human accounts against your DCs (or whichever hosts are sending those SecurityEvents).

This is excellent for:
- quick incident triage
- “did anyone RDP in recently?” validation
- session-lifecycle context (connect/disconnect/reconnect patterns)

<br/>

## 🛡️ Regulatory & Framework Mapping (for both RDP queries)
**NIST 800-53**
- AU-2 / AU-6: access/session events are auditable and must be reviewed
- AC-2 / AC-6: supports account management and least privilege oversight
- SI-4: monitoring for suspicious access patterns

<br/>

**CMMC 2.0**
- AC.L2-3.1.1 / AC.L2-3.1.2: control/monitor access to systems
- AU.L2-3.3.1 / AU.L2-3.3.3: collect/review audit logs of access activity
- IR.L2-3.6.1 (supporting evidence): session visibility helps incident handling

<br/>

**CIS Controls v8**
- Control 6: Access Control Management
- Control 8: Audit Log Management
- Control 13 (supporting): Network Monitoring & Defense (RDP is a high-value vector)

<br/>

## ⚔️ Steps to Operationalize (RDP Query Version A)

- Use it as triage
- Run it during investigations to answer: “Who RDP’d into DCs recently?”
- Define what “should never happen”
- Many orgs decide: “Nobody should RDP to DCs directly.”
    - If that’s your stance, this query becomes an instant detection source.
- Turn into alerts...
    - Alert conditions might include:
        - Any RDP logon to DCs by non-approved admin accounts
        - Any RDP session outside maintenance windows

### Example Use Case: 
- Junk-click user → did they later appear here?
- AD user deletion occurred → was the same actor RDP’d in beforehand?
- Transition: From “timeline” to “outlier radar” 📈
- Query A gives you the forensic timeline — great for answering “what happened and when?”.

<br/><br/>

# “Who’s the outlier?”

That’s why we pivot to the next query: it compresses 30 days of RDP logons into a timechart so abnormal spikes jump off the screen.

## RDP Query B — Logon volume timechart (outlier detector)

```kql
SecurityEvent
| where TimeGenerated > ago(30d)
| where EventID == 4624  // Focus on successful logons only
| where AccountType != "Machine"
| where Account !has "SYSTEM" and Account !endswith "$"
| where LogonType == 10  // RDP only
| extend User = coalesce(TargetUserName, Account)
| summarize LoginCount = count() by 
    Day = bin(TimeGenerated, 1d),
    User
| order by Day desc, LoginCount desc
| render timechart 
```

### [🔗 Who's Logging In and When?.kql](https://github.com/EEN421/KQL-Queries/blob/Main/Who's%20Logging%20In%20and%20When%3F.kql)

<br/>

## Line-by-line breakdown (only what’s new vs Query A)

### `| where EventID == 4624`

Unlike Query A (which includes session lifecycle events), this one focuses purely on successful logons.

✅ Why: It creates a consistent “countable” signal for trending.

<br/>

### `| summarize LoginCount = count() by Day = bin(TimeGenerated, 1d), User`

This is the magic.

bin(TimeGenerated, 1d) groups events into daily buckets

then counts how many RDP logons each user had per day

✅ Why it matters: this turns raw logs into a behavior metric you can baseline.

<br/>

### `| render timechart`

Instant visualization.

✅ Why it matters: it gives you a quick visual to identify outliers (your stated goal):
- “Why did this user have 70 RDP logons on Tuesday?”
- “Why did RDP activity spike across multiple users on the same day?”

<br/>

## ⚔️ Steps to Operationalize (RDP Query Version B)

- Use this as the daily “RDP health chart”
- Add it to a workbook and check it as part of shift turnover.
- Baseline and detect spikes
    - After 2–4 weeks, you’ll know what “normal” looks like.
    - Anything above baseline becomes a review trigger.
- Create a follow-up drilldown workflow
- Click spike day/user → run Query A filtered to that user/day to get the session story.
- Alert on volume thresholds
    - Example: “User exceeds X RDP logons/day” (tune per environment)
- Harden based on what you learn
- Move admin access to jump boxes only
- Reduce direct RDP pathways
- Require stronger controls around interactive admin behavior
